# Contributing to the OHM Community Handbook

Thank you for helping to build the OHM Protocol community.

## How to contribute

- **Fix typos / clarify text**:  
  Open a pull request with your edits and a short description.

- **Add a new guide or template**:  
  - Create a new file in the most relevant folder (for example, `playbooks/` or `templates/`).
  - Add a short intro at the top explaining what it is for and who it helps.
  - Open a pull request.

- **Larger changes** (new sections, new structure, etc.):  
  - Open an issue first describing the idea.
  - We’ll discuss and agree on a shape before you spend lots of time.
