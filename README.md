# OHM Community Handbook

The OHM Community Handbook is the public guide to how we work together to build OHM Protocol as a global public good.

It collects:

- Community principles and culture.
- Roles and guilds.
- Onboarding guides for new builders.
- Playbooks for collaboration (GitHub, Discord, Notion, etc.).
- Templates for rituals, meetings, and community programmes.

This repository is primarily **documentation**, not product code. It is meant to be readable and useful to anyone who wants to understand or help steward the OHM movement.

## Structure (draft)

- `principles/` – values, culture, and code of conduct.
- `onboarding/` – how to join, first steps for contributors.
- `guilds/` – descriptions of guilds and roles.
- `playbooks/` – practical guides for recurring activities.
- `templates/` – reusable checklists, message templates, etc.

_(We can adjust these folders as the handbook evolves.)_
